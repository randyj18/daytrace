# **App Name**: Daytrace

## Core Features:

- JSON Import: Import a JSON file or data structure containing a list of questions.
- JSON Export: Export the updated JSON data at any time.
- Read Aloud: Text-to-Speech (TTS) reads aloud the current question.
- Transcribe Answers: Speech-to-Text (STT) transcribes spoken answers.
- Voice Command Recognition: The app listens for the wake word 'Daytrace', then uses voice command recognition for commands like 'Repeat', 'Previous', 'Clear answer', 'Skip', 'Jump to question [number]', and 'Summary'.
- Responsive UI: Minimalist GUI displays current question, its status, and progress. Includes controls for JSON import/export. UI adapts for desktop and mobile.
- Progress Summary: Voice summary of progress: number of questions answered and list of any skipped questions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#1A612D) reflecting growth, focus, and harmony with the application's purpose of structured Q&A.
- Background color: A light beige (#F5F5DC) providing a natural and calming environment.
- Accent color: An earthy brown (#A0522D) used for highlights and interactive elements, drawing attention and signaling functionality.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) provides a modern, neutral, and highly readable interface suitable for both question display and UI elements.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets (monospaced).
- A nature-inspired layout emphasizes focus. Key elements are visually separated, using natural curves and forms where appropriate. Use responsive design to work across devices.
- Subtle animations on transition of questions, import/export, inspired by natural movements (e.g., leaves falling, water flowing). Simple cues acknowledge user interactions to enhance the experience without distraction.
